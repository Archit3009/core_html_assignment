 <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses various tasks, including web design, content creation, coding, and server-side scripting. Web developers use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the structure, style, and functionality of websites. They also work with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js to streamline development and enhance user experience. Additionally, web developers collaborate with designers, content creators, and clients to ensure that the final product meets the desired objectives and functions seamlessly across different devices and browsers.</p>
